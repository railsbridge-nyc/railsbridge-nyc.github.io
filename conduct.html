          <h1>RailsBridge NYC Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>
            RailsBridge NYC is dedicated to providing
            a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone,
            regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
            tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.
            Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
            conference venue, including talks. Workshop participants
            violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
            workshop at the discretion of the workshop organizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
            sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
            religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
            stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
            disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
            unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
            behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in
            harassing behavior, the workshop organizers may take any action they
            deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
            workshop. If you are being harassed, notice that
            someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
            contact a member of workshop staff immediately. Workshop staff will
            be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
            enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
            harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value
            your attendance.
